## General Info
The mRNA virus called coronavirus interrupted our lives. As the Germans say, “Wir haben coronamüde!”  

The theme of this project is mutative new people and the city that turned pink after the epidemic. Our player, who has not completed his transformation yet, is taking firm steps towards finding the main facility with the hope of treatment! The facility remains a mystery and no one knows what is inside.  

In this challenging journey, we recommend that you replenish your battery and ammos (bullets, shells, rockets) by collecting around because you never know where the mutants will come from! You have 3 different weapon options, and they all have different ammo and ranges. You can switch between weapons with the mouse scroll wheel and follow the ammo amount from the upper right corner.  

Good luck friend! The fate of humanity is in your hands.
